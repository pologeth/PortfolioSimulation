# Portfolio Simulation: Monte Carlo Analysis
**Overview
This project provides a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze a diversified portfolio's potential outcomes over one year of trading days (252 days). The simulation calculates key portfolio statistics such as average portfolio value, standard deviation, and Value at Risk (VaR), and provides a sensitivity analysis of assets. The results are visualized using Python libraries like Bokeh and Seaborn.
